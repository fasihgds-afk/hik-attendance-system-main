/**
 * Weekend / Saturday policy helpers.
 *
 * Supports:
 * - Department policy: 'all_off' (every Saturday off) or 'alternate' (1st/3rd vs 2nd/4th by employee group).
 * - Employee saturdayGroup: 'A' = off 1st & 3rd Saturday; 'B' = off 2nd & 4th Saturday.
 *   When policy is 'alternate', 5th Saturday is treated as working for both groups.
 *
 * @param {number} saturdayIndex - Which Saturday of the month (1..5).
 * @param {{ saturdayGroup?: string }} employee - Must have saturdayGroup 'A' or 'B' when policy is 'alternate'.
 * @param {Map<string, string>} departmentPolicyMap - Map of department name → 'all_off' | 'alternate'.
 * @param {string} [departmentName] - Employee's department name (optional; if missing, 'alternate' is assumed).
 * @returns {boolean} - True if this Saturday is off for this employee.
